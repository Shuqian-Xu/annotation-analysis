His entrepreneurialism started young. The family would visit the Mojave desert, where Larry would collect snakes (conventional pets were not allowed at home because his mother was allergic to animal hair). He developed a small business dealing in them and would post his haul to collectors across America \u2013 until some slithered out in transit. When he was 12 or 13, the fbi showed up at his parents\u2019 door. Despite the scolding, his passion for snakes continues. He can still identify a venomous one at a glance.\n\nFink imbibed the free-spirited atmosphere of the west coast in the 1960s. He wore his hair long and, he claims, once served George Harrison while working as a waiter during his teens. At university he developed an interest in real estate. To this day he can reel off the square footage of the house and holiday home he grew up in.\n\nBut in the 1970s, Wall Street offered more excitement than selling property. Michael Milken, an earlier graduate of the same secondary school as Fink, was innovating in risky high-yield bonds. The first private-equity firms were beginning their corporate raids. Fink abandoned his early passion and joined First Boston in New York, an investment bank with a wasp-y reputation. "

A lot of esg is flim-flam. The theory behind it suggests that you can measure companies\u2019 performance on metrics other than financial returns, though the scoring systems are subjective, inconsistent and often set goals that conflict with each other. Less than 3% of BlackRock\u2019s investments in America are esg-related, but Fink has made himself the face of the movement since 2016, when he began urging the chief executives of the companies in BlackRock\u2019s portfolio, in increasingly strident terms, to make their businesses more sustainable.\n\nConsumers\u2019 Research and other well-funded right-wing organisations have formed a powerful lobby transmitting the message deep into Republican-governed states that esg is wrecking social norms and dooming fossil-fuel production, on which many rely for jobs and tax revenue. This year alone, Republican lawmakers in 37 states have proposed at least 167 laws targeting esg (most have not passed). Some states have blacklisted firms like BlackRock from handling their investments. Call it defunding the climate police.\n\nFink has become the right wing\u2019s b\u00eate noire.

Stung by the trading debacle, Fink and seven partners co-founded an asset-management company a year and a half later in 1988. Its main business was investing money from pension funds and other long-term asset holders in bonds. From the inception, Fink put risk management at its core, bringing in mathematical experts and computer whizzkids to calculate the repayment probabilities of individual loans in a bond portfolio and assess how their value would be affected by changes in interest rates. Eventually, the software would be so successful that BlackRock would license it to 130,000 financial-services firms.\n\nInitially, the firm was called Blackstone Financial Management since Blackstone, a private-equity firm, took a half-stake in the project. The two firms were united for seven years until Stephen Schwarzman, Blackstone\u2019s co-founder, rebelled after finding out that Fink and the other founders were diluting everyone\u2019s stakes by issuing stock options to new joiners. After a row with Fink, he agreed to sell his shares. The liberated firm was renamed BlackRock.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s central nervous system may be attuned to risk mitigation, but its culture is far from bloodless. Co-founders and former colleagues say that, from the start, Fink behaved as though the firm were a kibbutz or a family \u2013 clan-like, energised, argumentative.
