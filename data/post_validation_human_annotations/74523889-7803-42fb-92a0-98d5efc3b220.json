				},

				},
				{
					"text": "A columnist for the New York Post wrote, tongue-in-cheek, that 'it made me wonder whether this dude was about to assign a hit squad to come to my house.'"
				},
				{

				},
				{
					"text": "Whoislarryfink.com accuses Fink of being enamoured of China and exploiting those in financial misfortune, but it doesn't mention the most salient facts."
				},
				{
					"text": "He is the 70-year-old chairman and chief executive of BlackRock, the world's biggest asset manager."
				},
				{
					"text": "When Fink talks, people listen – and Fink certainly likes to talk."
				},
				{
					"text": "Less than 3% of BlackRock's investments in America are esg-related, but Fink has made himself the face of the movement since 2016, when he began urging the chief executives of the companies in BlackRock's portfolio, in increasingly strident terms, to make their businesses more sustainable."
				},
				{
					"text": "Fink has become the right wing's bête noire."
				},
				{
					"text": "This was made clear last year when Peter Thiel, a venture capitalist and conservative rabble-rouser, attacked esg at a Bitcoin conference in Miami, as Fink's face stared out of the screen behind him."
				},
				{
					"text": "When I met Fink at his bucolic farm an hour from New York City, he was determined to show that he had put all this furore behind him."
				},
				{
					"text": "He is an ebullient conversationalist, rhapsodising about the catch of a lifetime in March while fly-fishing in Mexico."
				},
				{
					"text": "Yet when I asked him if he would have done anything differently to avoid the backlash, he ducked the issue by questioning the value of counterfactuals."
				},
				{
					"text": "Some in his orbit told me he struggles to admit he is wrong."
				},
				{
					"text": "'Everyone asks me what are the things in life that I would do differently. And I would say nothing,' Fink said."
				},
				{
					"text": "One former colleague, usually in awe of Fink's energy, was shocked to find him looking 'sad, tired and older' last year as the campaign against him heated up."
				},
				{
					"text": "Another close observer likens the treatment of Fink to that of Emmanuel Goldstein, the enemy of the state in George Orwell's '1984', whose image is shown on a screen and abused by viewers during a daily ritual called the 'Two Minutes Hate'."
				},

					"text": "Fink receives sinister emails every day."
				},

				},
				{
					"text": "Last year, BlackRock's board authorised the firm to provide him with bodyguards."
				},
				{
					"text": "For safety's sake, it obliges him to use a private jet (which he frequently did anyway, even as he promoted sustainable investments)."
				},
				{
					"text": "Security cameras were installed on the farm where we met."
				},
				{
					"text": "BlackRock's success has been built on a rigorous approach to risk management – a lesson Fink learned after a career-defining mishap on Wall Street."
				},
				{
					"text": "You might expect the person who has led such a firm since its founding to be cool, methodical and unemotive."
				},
				{
					"text": "Yet Fink couldn't be more different."
				},
				{
					"text": "One former employee called him 'exceptionally intuitive'."
				},
				{
					"text": "He loves shooting the breeze on the phone – he calls his wife multiple times a day – and improvises in meetings with global poobahs."
				},
				{
					"text": "Another former employee once sent Fink a text message saying he'd rather be loved than respected."
				},
				{
					"text": "Fink replied, 'We all would.'"
				},
				{
					"text": "His yearning for admiration can make him thin-skinned and conscious of his status."
				},
				{
					"text": "In recent years, as he has jetted around the world to chew the fat with corporate clients, prime ministers and central bankers, he seems to have enjoyed his job as much for the platform it gave him as for the money it generates."
				},
				{
					"text": "Raising the banner for esg seemed to offer the opportunity to cement his importance as a financial statesman – and for BlackRock to make a killing at the same time."
				},
				{
					"text": "To understand Larry Fink, you need to understand what went wrong."
				},
				{
					"text": "I first spoke to Fink via a video call in February, as he sat in his office in a converted barn on the farm, where he spends the weekends."
				},
				{
					"text": "Even on screen, he is an imposing presence."
				},
				{
					"text": "His voice booms as he expresses his reluctance to be profiled."
				},
				{
					"text": "'My biggest issue is that I'm overly exposed,' he says."
				},
				{
					"text": "Still, he can barely stop himself talking."
				},
				{
					"text": "I am calling him from Los Angeles, the city where he was born and lived for the first 23 years of his life."
				},
				{
					"text": "Within minutes, he is telling me in vivid detail about growing up in California 'amid orange groves and tumbleweed'."
				},
				{
					"text": "Fink was born in 1952 to a Jewish family in Van Nuys, a sprawling suburb."
				},
				{
					"text": "His parents were Democrats – his father ran a shoe shop and his mother was a university professor."
				},
				{
					"text": "He went to state schools, which, he says, made him the person he is."
				},
				{
					"text": "His entrepreneurialism started young."
				},
				{
					"text": "The family would visit the Mojave desert, where Larry would collect snakes (conventional pets were not allowed at home because his mother was allergic to animal hair)."
				},
				{
					"text": "He developed a small business dealing in them and would post his haul to collectors across America – until some slithered out in transit."
				},
				{
					"text": "When he was 12 or 13, the fbi showed up at his parents' door."
				},
				{
					"text": "Despite the scolding, his passion for snakes continues."
				},
				{
					"text": "He can still identify a venomous one at a glance."
				},
				{
					"text": "Fink imbibed the free-spirited atmosphere of the west coast in the 1960s."
				},
				{
					"text": "He wore his hair long and, he claims, once served George Harrison while working as a waiter during his teens."
				},
				{
					"text": "At university he developed an interest in real estate."
				},
				{
					"text": "To this day he can reel off the square footage of the house and holiday home he grew up in."
				},
				{
					"text": "Michael Milken, an earlier graduate of the same secondary school as Fink, was innovating in risky high-yield bonds."
				},
				{
					"text": "Fink abandoned his early passion and joined First Boston in New York, an investment bank with a wasp-y reputation."
				},
				{
					"text": "'I was a freak,' he tells me, chuckling at the memory."
				},
				{
					"text": "'I was told I was hired because I was Jewish and Jews were smart. But it was a meritocracy.'"
				},
				{
					"text": "Fink's property experience landed him a job as a mortgage trader, a much lowlier position than the plummy investment bankers doing mergers and acquisitions."
				},
				{
					"text": "A former employee once sent Fink a text message saying he'd rather be loved than respected."
				},
				{
					"text": "Fink replied, 'We all would'"
				},
				{
					"text": "Fink set his sights on toppling Lewis Ranieri, a bond trader who had worked his way up from the postroom to lead Salomon Brothers to pre-eminence in the mortgage market."
				},
				{
					"text": "Henry Fernandez, ceo of msci, a provider of investment indices, watched in awe from the sidelines as Fink single-handedly sought to dethrone Salomon."
				},
				{
					"text": "'Imagine a guy of that age joining a genteel firm and building its mortgage business from scratch. The partners were bankers, not traders. You can imagine the force of personality he needed.'"
				},
				{
					"text": "As the competition between him and Ranieri brewed, Fink loaded up on mortgages that led to cratering losses when interest rates unexpectedly fell."
				},
				{
					"text": "He went from being the wunderkind who had brought in $1bn in the space of a few years to the pariah blamed for losing $100m in a quarter – a staggering loss at First Boston."
				},
				{
					"text": "Suddenly he was treated like a 'leper', he recalls."
				},
				{
					"text": "When we talk, it's clear he still ruminates on his failure."
				},
				{
					"text": "The experience gave him a life-long obsession with risk."
				},
				{
					"text": "Stung by the trading debacle, Fink and seven partners co-founded an asset-management company a year and a half later in 1988."
				},
				{
					"text": "From the inception, Fink put risk management at its core, bringing in mathematical experts and computer whizzkids to calculate the repayment probabilities of individual loans in a bond portfolio and assess how their value would be affected by changes in interest rates."
				},
				{
					"text": "The two firms were united for seven years until Stephen Schwarzman, Blackstone's co-founder, rebelled after finding out that Fink and the other founders were diluting everyone's stakes by issuing stock options to new joiners."
				},
				{
					"text": "After a row with Fink, he agreed to sell his shares."
				},
				{
					"text": "Co-founders and former colleagues say that, from the start, Fink behaved as though the firm were a kibbutz or a family – clan-like, energised, argumentative."
				},
				{
					"text": "Hugh Frater, one of the co-founders, concedes that Fink was a 'bit of a yeller' in the early days, but also recalls how he would ask, 'Do you want a bagel?' as a peace offering."
				},
				{
					"text": "He can be solicitous."
				},
				{
					"text": "Ex-colleagues say he has helped to arrange hospital treatment for their family members, supported their book projects and provided money for their startups."
				},
				{
					"text": "Barbara Novick, one of two women co-founders, says Fink was 'very supportive and open' about maternity leave before it was customary."
				},
				{
					"text": "To this day, Fink is the undisputed patriarch, setting long-term strategy."
				},
				{
					"text": "His own contribution is more charismatic than forensic: he charms clients on board, immerses himself in leadership development and gossips with influential contacts about the state of the markets."
				},
				{
					"text": "He leaves the dogsbody work of running the firm to others."
				},
				{
					"text": "Colleagues recall withering put-downs if he feels they are being complacent."
				},
				{
					"text": "'You guys have got to stop dragging your dicks across the floor,' one remembers him shouting at a group of BlackRock employees, women among them."
				},
				{
					"text": "Yet he has managed to instil loyalty in his colleagues and cultivate a sense of camaraderie."
				},
				{
					"text": "The old-timers formed a court around King Larry from which more recent joiners could feel excluded."
				},
				{
					"text": "Like many heads of family businesses, Fink cares more about the health of the firm than what he can extract."
				},
				{
					"text": "His stake in BlackRock today is a relatively modest 0.3%; he has frequently reduced his shareholding as the firm has grown and is considerably outearned by his fellow plutocrats."
				},
				{
					"text": "According to Forbes, he's worth $1bn; Schwarzman's net worth is about $30bn."
				},
				{
					"text": "Fink may not measure himself by the billions in his bank account, but he has other ways of valuing his self-worth."
				},
				{
					"text": "The other is his personal standing."
				},
				{
					"text": "Fink had three traits – his understanding of mortgages, his stomach for big wagers and his clubbable ease with the titans of Wall Street and Washington – that swiftly catapulted him and his firm to prominence."
				},
				{
					"text": "Fink has a passion for fishing in remote places."
				},
				{
					"text": "He takes a trip each year out west or to Alaska or Mexico."
				},
				{
					"text": "Many members of the party will be clients or colleagues, but he also takes along Kenny Smith, an instructor who gave Fink his first fly-fishing lesson 25 years ago."
				},
				{
					"text": "They have been friends since then."
				},
				{
					"text": "They make a strange pairing: a Coloradan from the boondocks and a billionaire raised on one coast and made on the other."
				},
				{
					"text": "On the river bank, the deference towards Fink falls away."
				},
				{
					"text": "Smith notes the patience with which Fink pursues his catch."
				},
				{
					"text": "He is 'analysing all the time he's out there,' Smith says."
				},
				{
					"text": "Fink went from being the wunderkind who had brought in $1bn in the space of a few years to the pariah blamed for losing $100m in a quarter"
				},
				{
					"text": "Fink has stalked the acquisitions which have turned BlackRock into a financial leviathan with similar circumspection."
				},
				{
					"text": "He says he backed away once before buying Merrill Lynch Investment Management, an asset manager that specialised in global equities, in 2006."
				},
				{
					"text": "The purchase in 2009 of Barclays Global Investors (bgi), the world's biggest seller of low-fee passive funds, was Fink's second attempt at buying the firm."
				},
				{
					"text": "Even then, the deal almost fell apart at the last minute, because of Fink's concerns about the provenance of some of the finance for the transaction."
				},
				{
					"text": "At the time, he recalls, one of his grandchildren had just been born."
				},
				{
					"text": "The situation was so tense that, rather than staying with his family, he returned to the office and hammered the phones all night trying to raise alternative sources of cash."
				},
				{
					"text": "Robert Fairbairn, a vice-chairman of BlackRock, remembers how winningly blunt Fink was about his predicament as he called in favours."
				},
				{
					"text": "'I'm in a bind,' he confessed to his potential rescuers."
				},
				{
					"text": "'We've got this incredible deal. If we don't get there, you know, we're not going to make it happen…I'm going to work tirelessly to get it back.'"
				},
				{
					"text": "With support from sovereign-wealth funds, including those in Singapore and China, he reeled in the deal the next morning."
				},
				{
					"text": "For the first time, Fink brought two conflicting investment strategies under one roof: active management, led by specialists charging fat fees for their supposed clairvoyance in picking stocks; and low-fee passive investing, in which funds buy the entire index on the assumption that the market always wins in the end."
				},
				{
					"text": "Fink's bet on bgi helped slash the investment costs for millions whose retirement savings are invested via BlackRock."
				},
				{
					"text": "It also reflected a shrewd insight he developed early in his career: that as the capital markets became cheaper and easier to access, people would increasingly save by buying stocks and bonds, rather than by stuffing money into bank deposits."
				},
				{
					"text": "The old-timers formed a court around King Larry from which more recent joiners could feel excluded"
				},
				{
					"text": "The bgi transaction coincided with Fink's growing stature as a financial Mr Fix-it."
				},
				{
					"text": "During the financial crisis, he provided vital assistance to America's Treasury and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York by selling or rescuing distressed financial firms such as Bear Stearns and aig."
				},
				{
					"text": "BlackRock's risk-management algorithm allowed him to analyse their exposure as few others could."
				},
				{
					"text": "His rescue work spread to Europe, where the banking systems in many countries were struggling with their own mortgage-related meltdowns."
				},
				{
					"text": "As markets sank, Fink frequently acted as a conduit of information between officials and Wall Street's masters of the universe – eventually he picked up lots of business for BlackRock selling off troubled assets on behalf of the government."
				},
				{
					"text": "Some who know him say that his bolstered stature fed a psychological need to be the centre of attention."
				},
				{
					"text": "A former employee there at the time says Fink used to talk in private about his childhood dream of becoming a rock star, though he confessed to them that he was not good-looking enough."
				},
				{
					"text": "(Talk Talk, a beguiling British act from the 1980s and 1990s that mysteriously fled from fame, is his favourite band.)"
				},
				{
					"text": "The acquisition of bgi gave Fink a platform from which to pontificate."
				},
				{
					"text": "Fink swiftly exercised his clout."
				},
				{
					"text": "In 2012 he began a tradition of writing 'Dear ceo' letters to the bosses of the firms in which BlackRock invested."
				},
				{
					"text": "This allowed him to indulge a streak of sanctimony that, at times, could make him sound like the Bono of the bond markets."
				},
				{
					"text": "The man who had once shunned the annual glad-handing of the financial elite at Davos as 'a waste of time', started to become a regular."
				},
				{
					"text": "Rumour has it that during President Barack Obama's second term he was approached to become America's treasury secretary, a post that some of his friends say he covets dearly – though Fink demurs when asked about it."
				},
				{
					"text": "Instead he became a financial diplomat."
				},
				{
					"text": "BlackRock's increasing size gave him access to the world's financial capitals."
				},
				{
					"text": "He hit the skies in one of the firm's two Gulfstream private jets, schmoozing international clients, the bosses of big companies, presidents, prime ministers and central bankers."
				},
				{
					"text": "Besides winning new business, he uses his travels to gauge what is on the mind of his interlocutors and test out ideas."
				},
				{
					"text": "Those around him say these trips are exhausting, if exhilarating; despite his age, Fink is always pushing for more meetings."
				},
				{
					"text": "He fancies himself able to get an audience with almost anyone."
				},
				{
					"text": "His travels also allow Fink to indulge his passion for name-dropping, which he does more to gossip than brag."
				},
				{
					"text": "You might hear him relate how he has discussed Brexit with a British prime minister, or struck up a personal friendship with Andrés Manuel López Obrador, Mexico's strongly anti-elite leftist president."
				},
				{
					"text": "Fink is not picky about whom he gets close to."
				},
				{
					"text": "He was one of the first New York financiers to declare he wasn't cutting ties with Saudi Arabia after the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a columnist for the Washington Post."
				},
				{
					"text": "'The last thing he will do is stop talking to people, even when it's uncomfortable,' says Fairbairn."
				},
				{
					"text": "David Rubenstein, co-chairman of the Carlyle Group, a private-equity firm, says Fink's stature in global financial circles is greater than that of many government ministers."
				},
				{
					"text": "'He's effectively become global secretary of the Treasury without the official title,' he quips."
				},
				{
					"text": "Fink's farm is in a wealthy part of New York state that is so horsey the local coffee shop has free carrots as well as dog treats on the counter."
				},
				{
					"text": "In 2003 he bought the house and outbuildings, which were built in the 18th century, from the actor and film-maker Stanley Tucci."
				},
				{
					"text": "They were in a dilapidated state and he has since restored them."
				},
				{
					"text": "He also expanded his domain by buying land from a neighbour who lost a fortune after investing with Bernie Madoff."
				},
				{
					"text": "Over two decades, Fink and his landscapers have turned the property into a wildlife sanctuary."
				},
				{
					"text": "They've ripped out invasive species, such as Japanese barberry, and seeded vast meadows with indigenous flowers – milkweeds, echinacea and Indian paintbrush – creating a haven for birds and insects."
				},
				{
					"text": "So devoted is Fink to rewilding that he once harangued a colleague who became a beekeeper because honey bees are 'non-native'."
				},
				{
					"text": "(She eventually convinced him to keep her bees on his property.)"
				},
				{
					"text": "Fink fancies himself able to get an audience with almost anyone."
				},
				{
					"text": "From the mid-2010s onwards, Fink started to display some of the same zeal about environmental matters writ large."
				},
				{
					"text": "Fink's background selling mortgage bonds disposed him more than other financiers to worry about the state of the planet in 30 years' time."
				},
				{
					"text": "He saw that the push to decarbonise the world's energy infrastructure would require huge new investments that his firm could help finance."
				},
				{
					"text": "Many of Fink's clients – especially younger ones – welcomed him taking a stand."
				},
				{
					"text": "Fink felt it posed a risk that chief executives had a responsibility to tackle."
				},
				{
					"text": "Climate change wasn't just a sound financial concern: it gave Fink an unparalleled opportunity to grandstand from what one former colleague calls the 'bully pulpit' that BlackRock offers."
				},
				{
					"text": "None of his peers had such a cause to trumpet."
				},
				{
					"text": "His annual letters to ceos of firms in BlackRock's portfolios – which because of their size meant almost all of the big ones – attracted widespread media attention."
				},
				{
					"text": "Months after the Paris agreement in 2015, in which governments committed themselves to limiting global warming to less than two degrees above pre-industrial times by 2100, Fink used his annual letter to invoke esg for the first time, saying BlackRock expected companies to incorporate environmental and social considerations into their discussions with boards."
				},
				{
					"text": "Though Fink continues to deny to this day that he was on a crusade, saying that he was simply looking after his clients' long-term interests, he sounded more evangelical with each passing year."
				},
				{
					"text": "He began to argue that business must address the most pressing economic and social issues amid 'wrenching political dysfunction'."
				},
				{
					"text": "His letter in 2020 was pivotal."
				},
				{
					"text": "In it he wrote that climate change had become 'a defining factor in companies' long-term prospects'."
				},
				{
					"text": "He announced BlackRock's aggressive new esg strategies, such as divesting the shares of large coal producers from its active funds, as well as offering funds that screened out fossil-fuel producers altogether."
				},
				{
					"text": "Fink, who has a salesman's knack for seeing which way the wind is blowing – quite literally, he has a collection of antique weather vanes at his farm – was quick to spot the potential for growth."
				},
				{
					"text": "'Larry has an incredible nose for the trends that are coming down in the industry,' says Robert Kapito, BlackRock's president and Fink's partner for 40 years."
				},
				{
					"text": "Tariq Fancy, former chief investment officer for sustainability at BlackRock, who, after quitting, wrote a lengthy critique of esg, says Fink was quick to seize on the chance to turn BlackRock into a sustainability champion, though with the bottom line in mind."
				},
				{
					"text": "Regardless of the actual extent of Fink's fervour for sustainable investment, there was growing concern within parts of the firm that he risked overstepping the mark."
				},
				{
					"text": "Another saw 'a lot of people tell Larry we don't need to be vocal about this. But Larry was absolutely at the forefront of it.'"
				},
				{
					"text": "According to one senior Republican official in a red state, 'If you talk to his employees, they go: 'Oh don't worry about what Larry says. That's not what we're doing.''"
				},
				{
					"text": "He adds, 'I cannot tell you how many conversations we've had where [employees] said: 'We'd get rid of him too, but, you know, we can't.''"
				},
				{
					"text": "Some ceos also began to express concerns that Fink had grown too big for his boots."
				},
				{
					"text": "'I think the world of Larry Fink, but I'm not sure I want him to be my emperor,' said Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett's business partner."
				},
				{
					"text": "Fink says he doesn't recall any colleagues telling him that his letters were too political."
				},
				{
					"text": "But that suggests another potential problem: those who have worked at BlackRock describe him as a difficult person to contradict."
				},
				{
					"text": "He still dominates the firm and has a fearsome temper."
				},
				{
					"text": "More than one person described him to me as a narcissist."
				},
				{
					"text": "His reputation may explain why a firm renowned for its risk-management machinery managed to overlook the political backlash against esg."
				},
				{
					"text": "The pushback emerged chiefly from a group of politicians with whom the firm had almost completely lost touch as Fink swanned around the globe: Republicans in America's heartland."
				},
				{
					"text": "According to Fink, the trouble came to a head in the run-up to Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022."
				},
				{
					"text": "Texas senator Ted Cruz blasted Fink on television, accusing him of contributing directly to petrol-price rises by allegedly dissuading companies from investing in fossil fuels."
				},
				{
					"text": "He called it the 'Larry Fink surcharge'."
				},
				{
					"text": "Fink was horrified at how quickly the attacks became personal, especially as he had never insisted on divestment."
				},
				{
					"text": "His annual letter in 2020 was pivotal."
				},
				{
					"text": "In it he wrote that climate change had become 'a defining factor in companies' long-term prospects'."
				},
				{
					"text": "Brad Lander, a Democrat who scrutinises the New York City budget in his role of comptroller and is a trustee of three public-sector pension funds, fired a letter off to Fink arguing that BlackRock, in recognising its fossil-fuel investments, was effectively abdicating responsibility for reducing carbon emissions to net zero by 2050."
				},
				{
					"text": "Fink acknowledges that BlackRock's political antennae malfunctioned during this saga."
				},

				},
				{
					"text": "If they had been more nuanced, he says, he might have had fewer headaches."
				},
				{
					"text": "He insists his words were taken out of context, though now he talks more carefully about the concept of esg."
				},
				{
					"text": "'We don't use the word 'esg' anymore,' he says."
				},
				{
					"text": "'In my last letter I didn't mention esg,' he points out."
